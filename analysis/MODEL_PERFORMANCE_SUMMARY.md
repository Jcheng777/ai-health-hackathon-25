| Commercial     | 17.1%       | 100%           | 1,785       |

### **Performance by Billing Amount**
| Amount Range      | Denial Rate | Avg Amount | Claims |
|-------------------|-------------|------------|--------|
| Low ($0-$200)    | 14.3%       | $164       | 677    |
| Medium ($200-$500)| 16.1%       | $338       | 2,946  |
| High ($500-$1000) | 22.4%       | $648       | 1,346  |
| Very High ($1000+)| 29.0%       | $1,019     | 31     |
